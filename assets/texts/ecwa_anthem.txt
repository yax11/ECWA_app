Love for the dying
and the perishing;
A call to save the lost we heed;
Through the raging storms
and all uncertainties;
Our lives we freely give.

And through ECWA
your name be glorified
Oh God be glorified.

The bible our authority,
mission our identity,
Touching lives
with what we preach.
In life and speech,
faithful we shall be,
Drawing hearts of men to Christ.

And through ECWA
your name be glorified
Oh God be glorified.

Help the poor and homeless,
clothe the weak and cold
Giving all we have for Christ.
Our strength and substance
we will not spare,
We shall draw all men to Christ.

And through ECWA
your name be glorified
Oh God be glorified.

The vision of our fathers
will not die in our hands,
Like a candle in the dark we shine.
Breaking every stronghold
till the end of time,
Till our Lord and King we meet.

And through ECWA
your name be glorified
Oh God be glorified.
