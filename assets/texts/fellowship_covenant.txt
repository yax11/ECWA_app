We that are gathered here have been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ through faith. We have been baptized into his death and resurrection.
We have this promise before God and one another to abide by the teaching of God's holy word, walking and worthy of our calling.

We shall abstain from idolatry, adultery, fornication, dishonesty, gossiping, taking intoxicating drinks, stealing and all that bring dishonor to the name of the lord.

We shall give according to God's blessings to us for the support of the church work and God's ministers, also to help the needy.
We shall make other contributions which may be arranged by the leaders of ECWA for the progress of the work.

We shall help one another in the Christian faith. If a member falls into sin, we shall point out his fault to him in love so that he may get right with the lord.
We shall seek the salvation of our children and teach them to serve the lord faithfully. We shall pray and read God's word In our family daily.

We shall attend Sunday service, mid-week prayer meetings, holy communion and other Christian gathering with much zeal.

We shall endeavor to witness for Christ always through what we say and do.

We shall do all these through the power of the holy spirit. God help us.

AMEN!
